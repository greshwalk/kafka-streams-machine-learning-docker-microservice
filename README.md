# kafka-streams-machine-learning-docker-microservice
A Kafka Streams Microservice (using Machine Learning) deployed as a Docker Container

Related to the [Kafka Streams Machine Learning Examples](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/kafka-streams-machine-learning-examples). This project uses one of the examples (H2O GBM model to predict flight delays) and builds a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/
) image so that it can be deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Apache Mesos / DCOS](https://dcos.io/), or any other Container Orchestration Engine.

The project includes the (generated) target folder to show Docker File, structure of the project, etc. (for learning purpose).
