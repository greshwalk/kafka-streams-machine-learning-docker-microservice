Related to the [Kafka Streams Machine Learning Examples](https://github.com/kaiwaehner/kafka-streams-machine-learning-examples). This project uses one of the examples (H2O GBM model to predict flight delays) and builds a Docker image so that it can be deployed to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [Apache Mesos / DCOS](https://dcos.io/), or any other Container Orchestration Engine.
